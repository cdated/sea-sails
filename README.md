# About

This repo contains automation for small scale projects that focus on keeping
systems in equilibrium. These projects do periodic sensor reads and evaluate
the system state. Various changes may be automatically applied to the system
until the desired system state is achieved.

Each project below essentially implements a control loop. 

# Tanjiro

Maintain a bank of backup solar batteries by controlling an inverter and DC to
DC charger based on the batteries' state of charge.

# Yamato

Maintain the ideal temperature and humidity for indoor plants. Control vent
fans, UV lights, a dehumidifier, and water pumps.
